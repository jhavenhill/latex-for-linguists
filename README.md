latex-for-linguists
===================
These resources were used to teach the 2013 Georgetown GLSA LaTeX Workshop.

I'm not an expert in LaTeX by any means, so there's no guarantee that what I've written here is the best way of doing things. For instance, I no longer use the covington package, opting instead for gb4e. However, I do use LaTeX daily for my own work, and learn many new things all the time.

At any rate, I hope you'll find these resources useful.
