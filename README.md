latex-for-linguists
===================
These resources were used to teach the 2014 Georgetown GLSA LaTeX Workshop.

I'm not an expert in LaTeX by any means, so there's no guarantee that what I've written here is the best way of doing things. For instance, in the first version of this workshop I taught the Covington package, but have since switched to using gb4e. However, I do use LaTeX daily for my own work, and learn many new things all the time.

At any rate, I hope you'll find these resources useful.
